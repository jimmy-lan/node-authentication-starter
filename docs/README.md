## Overview

This repository includes the necessary files to quickly bootstrap a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server that has [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) functionalities built-in.
The server is capable to perform basic authentication strategy, bearer authentication strategy (through refresh tokens), and [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/).
[Rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) techniques are also implemented and will be explained in another page of this documentation.
The project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and **is opinionated**.
It is initially meant to serve as a starting point for personal and enterprise [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) projects inside of [Poly Team Solutions](https://github.com/Poly-Team).
